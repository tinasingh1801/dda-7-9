Insightful decision making is the process of using data-driven insights, rather than just 
intuition, to guide strategic and operational choices. It involves gathering and 
analyzing data to gain actionable, contextual, and forward-looking understanding 
that leads to better business outcomes, such as improved efficiency, customer 
satisfaction, and competitive advantage.
