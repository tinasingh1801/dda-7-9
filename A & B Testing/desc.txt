A/B Testing, also known as split testing, is a data-driven experimentation technique used to compare two versions of a webpage, application feature, advertisement, or any other product element to determine which one performs better in achieving a specific goal.
In this method, users are randomly divided into two groups:

Group A is shown the original version (known as the control), and

Group B is shown a modified version (known as the variant).

The performance of both versions is then measured using predefined metrics such as click-through rate, conversion rate, user engagement, or sales. Statistical analysis is applied to determine whether the differences observed between the two groups are statistically significant and not due to random chance.

A/B Testing helps organizations make evidence-based decisions rather than relying on intuition or assumptions. It allows marketers, product managers, and UX designers to optimize user experience, increase conversions, and improve overall business outcomes by continuously experimenting and learning what works best for their audience.
