Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. 
By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. 
Additionally, it provides an excellent way for employees or business owners to present data to non-technical audiences without confusion.
In the world of Big Data, data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven decisions.
The importance of data visualization is simple: it helps people see, interact with, and better understand data. 
Whether simple or complex, the right visualization can bring everyone on the same page, regardless of their level of expertise.
Effective data visualization is a delicate balancing act between form and function.
